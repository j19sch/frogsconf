FroGs conf is organized as an unconference, a conference format that follows the [Open Space Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Guiding_principles_and_one_law). The idea of an unconference is to learn from and share with each other. It’s a way to build a conference around those meaningful interactions you have during the breaks at a normal conference.

In this format, __attendees are also session contributors__. Anyone who wants to initiate a topic can claim a time slot in the conference schedule. Once you are at the conference, the __organizers' job is mostly over__. They have provided a space and the tools for the event, after this, it’s __up to you as a participant to make it a great event__.

We use the open space principles to organise our event. At the beginning of the conference we will go over the principles and rules to make sure everybody knows how the conference is run.


## Virtual Edition

Due to the uncertain circumstances in organizing a conference we have decided to not do a physical edition and do a virtual one instead.

Our team members - and perhaps you too - have in the past months organized and experienced very successful editions of virtual open space conferences. So we are confident we will be able to deliver a great event together with you.

We expect to use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and [Miro](https://miro.com/) as our main conference tools. We use [Slack](http://slack.com/) for pre-, side- and post conference discussions. You will be invited to our Slack channel before the conference.


## Open Space conferences

There are some simple rules for participants:

- __Whoever comes is the right people__  
	As a facilitator, you should welcome anyone who has decided to join your session, and not be frustrated if you expected different people.  
	As a participant, you should be ready to collaborate with anyone.

- __Whenever it starts is the right time__  
	As a facilitator, if you need some time to prepare, take it. This might lead to people getting bored and go join another session. The best is to prepare in advance.  
	As a participant, there is nothing wrong with joining a session in progress. But respect the people who have already started, and try to jump in quietly.

- __Wherever it is, is the right place__  
	You will be offered several spaces for your session. Choose the one that fits your needs as a facilitator or as a participant.

- __Whatever happens is the only thing that could have__  
	Be prepared to be surprised. Don’t be annoyed if you get feedback. Don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t work. Try again if need be.

- __When it’s over, it’s over__  
	As a facilitator, it’s up to you to mind your timebox. The organizers will not do it for you. Keep in mind that the participants of your session might want to go to another session after yours, and that the room might be reserved after. Feel free to continue in a different location with anyone who is interested.

### Law of two feet
If, during the course of the event, any person finds themselves in a session where they are neither learning nor contributing, they have the responsibility to themselves to stand up and go to some more interesting place.

## Possible session topics

Since it’s called “Friends of Good Software conference” we do expect topics to be related to the fields of sotware and quality:

- test approach and strategy
- oracles and heuristics
- testability
- documentation
- note taking
- quality and agile, scrum, waterfall, XP, ...
- automation in building, testing, deploying, ...
- tools
- risk analysis
- storytelling
- modelling & visualisation
- user story refinement
- communication skills
- collaboration skills
- problems you need help with
- how to hire new people
- ...

Be creative! Create your own session with the stuff you want to talk about, learn more about or let others help you solve a problem.
