FroGS Conf uses the [Open Space format](link://slug/event-format#open-space-format), so everyone can learn from and share with each other. In this format, __attendees are also session contributors__. It’s a way to build an experience focused on those meaningful interactions you have during the breaks at a normal conference.

Anyone who wants to initiate a topic can claim a slot in the agenda. Once you are at the event, the __organizers' job is mostly over__. They have provided a space and the tools for the event; it’s __up to you to participate and make it a great event__. At the beginning of the event, we will go over the open space principles and rules as a reminder.

# Which tools do you use?

- __[Whereby](https://whereby.com/) for video conferencing__  
  We're paying Whereby during the months when we host events. 

- __[Miro](https://miro.com/) for online whiteboarding__  
  We're using a paid instance of Miro (it's Joep's) to plan the schedule, pitch topics, and take notes during the sessions.

- __[Local Schedule](https://localschedule.netlify.app/) for scheduling across time zones__  
  [Markus Tacker](https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart), our steadfast supporter and originator of the FroGS name, built a great tool to view schedules in your own time zone.

- __[Slack](http://slack.com/) for event reminders and brainstorming topics__  
  The Slack invitation link is on the confirmation page once you register for an event.

- __Whoever comes is the right people__  
	As a facilitator, you should welcome anyone who has joined your session, and not frustrated if you expected different people.  
	As a participant, you should be ready to collaborate with anyone.

- __Whenever it starts is the right time__  
	As a facilitator, if you need some time to prepare, take it. This might lead to people getting bored and go join another session.
	As a participant, you're welcome to join sessions already in progress. Respect the people who have already started, and jump in quietly.

- __Wherever it is, is the right place__  
	You will be offered several spaces for your session. Choose the one that fits your needs as a facilitator or as a participant.

- __Whatever happens is the only thing that could have__  
	Be prepared to be surprised. Don’t be annoyed if you get feedback. Don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t work. Try again if need be.

- __When it’s over, it’s over__  
	As a facilitator, it’s up to you to mind your timebox. The organizers will not do it for you. Keep in mind that the participants of your session might want to go to another session after yours, and that the room might be reserved after. Feel free to continue in a different location with anyone who is interested.

## Law of mobility (law of two feet)
If anyone finds themselves in a session where they are neither learning nor contributing, they have the responsibility to themselves to go to a more interesting place.

# <a name="facilitating-a-session"></a> Facilitating a session

We have a dedicated channel in our Slack space called [`#friends-of-good-sessions`](https://frogsconf.slack.com/archives/C02QF5ME277) to support you in facilitating a session. If you want feedback on your idea or are looking for a co-facilitator, go there and ask!

## Possible session topics

Since the unconference is called “Friends of Good Software conference” we'd like to see sessions related to the themes of software and quality. For your session format you have several options: presentation, discussion, coaching session, workshop, trying out something new, etc. Find a format that works for you.
